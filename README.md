#DEP-Using-Python
 This repository contains all the jupyter notebook files regarding the domain of Data Extraction and Processing with the help of Python language. This was a part of my curriculum in my college's BTech (CE) course. The experiments span from basic file opening and reading to plotting graphs and exploring various datasets like customer_churn, indian_food, toyota etc using pandas. The graphing includes libraries like seaborn, matplotlib etc.
